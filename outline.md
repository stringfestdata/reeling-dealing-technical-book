The context

Assumptions:

 Why should you do it:

The process

How it works
- The acquisitions editor is the gatekeeper
  - Many of them are active on social media, and what to connect with you!
- Each publisher has its own aesthetic, find one that matches what you want

With the acquisitions editor
- Have 2-4 topics ready to discuss; full proposal not ready yet
 - But be able to get into the positioning of it
- After some back and forth, you may be asked to write the proposal

How to pick a good topic
- Don't reinvent the Bible
- Combining tools works well
- So does "X topic for Y audience"




How does the deal work?
- For first time authors, an advance is very unlikely 
- Maybe ask how many free copies you can get? 

Passed on to development editor
- Break bad habits
- Monitor schedule
- Be transparent!

... and write
- Write
- Write
- Write

How much writing?
- Plan at least 20 hours a week for 6+ months
- Lots of variables: How much preexisting content do you have?

Your writing squad
- Development editor
- Technical reviewers: who owes you a favor?

The aftermath
